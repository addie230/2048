Final project for the **Introduction to Programming Practicum course** @ Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University - a console-based remake of the game 2048.

## Main menu options:

### Starting a game:

When launching a new round, the game asks for a player nickname and the desired board dimension. 
Bigger boards provide longer gameplay and higher score potential. 
If you achieve a high enough score, you will be added to the Top 5 for that specific board size.

### Leaderboards:

The leaderboard section lets you view the best results across different dimensions and compare your scores with others.

### Exit:

Allows you to quit the game after you are done playing.


## In-Game commands
